description: Configure, extend, debug, test, or release ohm and develop other software projects with their own repository-defined workflows. Use when working with config.json, AGENTS.md, extensions, tools, commands, providers, MCP bridges, child agents, skills, prompts, themes, terminal UI, sessions, compaction, transports, the ohm source repository, another product repository, diagnostics, errors, logs, stats, crash reports, builds, tests, development servers, packages, or release verification.

# Develop ohm

Work against the installed or checked-out ohm version. Treat its documentation, declarations, tests, and focused examples as authoritative; do not invent APIs from memory.

## Route the task

Read only the relevant reference, but read that file completely before changing anything:

| Task | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Edit settings, keybindings, resource paths, or instructions | [Configuration](references/configuration.md) |
| Build or repair an extension, package, tool, command, MCP bridge, child-agent workflow, skill, prompt, theme, worker, or local dashboard | [Extensions](references/extensions.md) |
| Change ohm core, sessions, compaction, transports, providers, or terminal UI | [Core, TUI, and providers](references/core-tui-providers.md) |
| Develop, build, test, or run another software project | [Project development](references/project-development.md) |
| Diagnose, test, benchmark, install, package, or release | [Testing and release](references/testing-release.md) |

Read more than one reference only when the request crosses those boundaries.

## Work method

1. Identify whether the target is user configuration, a separate extension package, or the ohm source repository.
2. Inspect the nearest current docs, declarations, available source and tests, and one focused example before editing.
3. State the smallest observable acceptance criteria, target hosts, and any authority the result needs.
4. Change only the requested surface. Add a regression test for changed behavior.
5. Run focused verification first, then the documented boundary or release checks.
6. Report the changed root, user-visible behavior, checks, and any remaining limitation.

Prefer configuration or a declarative resource when code is unnecessary. Use an extension for optional, project-specific, or integration behavior that the public API can express. Change ohm source only for a product-wide invariant, a shared correctness or security fix, or a required host capability that the public extension API does not expose. When an extension needs a missing host capability, add the smallest general public capability in core, then keep the product behavior in the extension.

For an extension request, create the product in a fresh directory in the active workspace. Do not modify the installed ohm package, bundled examples, or a source checkout unless the user explicitly asks to maintain that exact target. Do not create or bundle another agent runtime. Grant callback child-agent authority only when the requested workflow explicitly needs delegation, and use the public bounded service instead of inventing a scheduler.

Keep user personalization separate. ohm creates the global `AGENTS.md` empty and preserves it; edit instruction files only when the user asks.

## Apply changes

After normal `config.json`, keybinding, extension, skill, prompt, theme, or instruction-file changes, ask the user to run `/refresh`. Do not invoke or simulate the slash command yourself. It preserves the active session and replaces the runtime generation transactionally.

`/refresh` does not load changed ohm source or rebuilt JavaScript modules. After a verified source change, build the exact runtime, wait for work to become idle, then tell the user to exit and relaunch the same durable session. Never restart the process automatically. Relaunch only for changed source or other process-bound state such as the Node runtime, native helper, launcher, inherited process environment, or a failure that prevents `/refresh` from running. Do not recommend a relaunch for ordinary resource or settings edits.
