# Resource catalog

`buildHarnessResourceCatalog()` is the public low-level projection helper exported by `ohm` and `ohm/service`. The host supplies its current:

- tools and ownership lookup;
- skills, providers, and runtime commands;
- extension catalog and package records;
- diagnostics.

The helper returns one deterministic, callback-free `HarnessResourceCatalog`. `parseHarnessResourceCatalog()` validates and detaches a catalog received across an application boundary.

The full catalog is not a method on `HarnessRuntime`, `EmbeddingHarness`, or the RPC protocol. Applications that own the required source objects build it explicitly.

Direct extensions use:

- `ohm.getCommands()` for the ordered invokable extension-command, prompt-template, and skill-command list;
- `ohm.getDiscoveryView()` for a richer bounded metadata snapshot;
- `resources_discover` to contribute package-relative skills, prompts, and custom themes.

The focused [`dynamic-package`](../examples/dynamic-package/README.md) demonstrates the contribution path.

Interactive `/resources` is a compact status report for the active extension bundle. It is not a serialized `HarnessResourceCatalog` and should not be parsed as one.

## Full catalog contract

The full projection can include:

- tool schemas and ownership;
- built-in, runtime, and template commands;
- prompt and skill metadata;
- custom themes and provider/model summaries;
- managed packages;
- extension status, trust, contribution counts, and diagnostics.

Package and extension entries preserve `user`, `project`, and invocation-only scope. Temporary `--extension` resources never look persistent. Declarative project packages can also expose their credential-free source declaration, deterministic disabled-resource filters, and immutable resolved version, revision, archive, content, and package digests.

Arrays are sorted, entry counts and bytes are bounded, and omitted counts are explicit. Consumers must check `schemaVersion` and `bounds.truncated`. A truncated catalog is valid: `bounds.omitted` reports the number of entries omitted from each section.

The catalog is discovery metadata, not an execution API. It never contains command or tool callbacks. It also never
contains:

- prompt/template contents or skill instructions;
- credential values or provider conversation state;
- model-private metadata;
- absolute local source paths or private package staging paths.

Blocked or untrusted extensions remain visible with their diagnostics. Their contributed tools, commands, prompts, and custom themes are not projected.

Validate untrusted or persisted data with `parseHarnessResourceCatalog()` before use. The parser rejects unknown fields, invalid bounds, inconsistent omitted counts, and callback-bearing or otherwise non-data values.
