# Keybindings

ohm maps keyboard input to named actions instead of hard-coding keys in each screen. Run `/hotkeys` to see the
active high-level bindings. A terminal emulator or multiplexer may consume a chord before ohm receives it. Test a
missing binding outside the multiplexer first.

## Message delivery, cancellation, and expansion

Enter starts a turn while idle. During an active run, Enter submits the draft as steering for the current run.
`Alt+Enter` submits a follow-up while active and inserts a newline while idle. Steering and follow-up queues each use
the configured `one-at-a-time` or `all` delivery mode.

`Alt+Up` removes all queued steering and follow-up messages and restores them, with their images and original order, to the editor. The queue remains visible above the composer until it is restored. `/follow MESSAGE` is the command form of follow-up delivery.

Escape is routed in this order:

1. A focused bounded component, or a raw component with `handleInput`, receives it.
2. A pending dialog or picker is cancelled.
3. The host interrupt handler may consume it.
4. An active run restores all queued messages to the editor, then cancels.
5. While idle with an empty editor, two presses within 500 ms run the configured `doubleEscapeAction`, which defaults to `atlas`; `none` disables it.

`Ctrl+C` cancels a picker. Otherwise it clears the draft and attachments. Press it twice within 500 ms while the
editor is empty to exit. `Ctrl+D` deletes forward in a nonempty editor and exits when the editor is empty. Completed
built-in tool rows start collapsed. `Ctrl+O` expands bounded retained tool output and bounded startup, skill, extension,
branch-summary, and compaction detail. Press it again to collapse them back to compact receipts.
`Ctrl+T` expands or collapses visible reasoning immediately in the rich viewport, including the currently streaming
block. Its header remains visible while hidden reasoning continues accumulating.
While collapsed, active Write shows its newest source rows and active Edit stays header-only. Expanding shows Write's
bounded retained head and tail, and shows Edit only after a complete old/new pair has been parsed; it never invents a
partial diff. The same state controls future, resumed, completed, and user-shell tool rendering. The terminal retains
at most 64 KiB of text for each tool result and renders at most 120 expanded rows per retained detail section.

## Complete action catalog

The following IDs are the complete `KEYBINDING_ACTIONS` catalog. An unbound action is supported but has no default chord. Platform-specific defaults are called out explicitly.

### Editor and input

| Action ID | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tui.editor.cursorUp` | Move up a visual row; at a single-line boundary, recall older history | `up` |
| `tui.editor.cursorDown` | Move down a visual row; at a single-line boundary, recall newer history | `down` |
| `tui.editor.cursorLeft` | Move left one grapheme | `left`, `ctrl+b` |

| `tui.editor.yank` | Insert the newest kill-ring entry | `ctrl+y` |
| `tui.editor.yankPop` | Replace the last yank with the next kill-ring entry | `alt+y` |
| `tui.editor.undo` | Undo one editor transaction | `ctrl+z` |
| `tui.editor.redo` | Redo one editor transaction | `ctrl+shift+z` |
| `tui.input.newLine` | Insert a newline in the multiline editor | `shift+enter`, `ctrl+j` |
| `tui.input.submit` | Submit the current editor value | `enter` |
| `tui.input.tab` | Open/apply autocomplete, then command or file completion | `tab` |
| `tui.input.copy` | Reserve the terminal copy-selection action for public editor components | `ctrl+c` |

### Selection and picker navigation

| Action ID | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tui.select.up` | Move selection up | `up`, `shift+tab` |
| `tui.select.down` | Move selection down | `down`, `tab` |
| `tui.select.pageUp` | Move selection up by a page | `pageup` |
| `tui.select.pageDown` | Move selection down by a page; at the session boundary, request more rows | `pagedown` |
| `tui.select.confirm` | Confirm the selected value | `enter` |
| `tui.select.cancel` | Cancel the current picker, dialog, or completion list | `escape`, `ctrl+c` |

Picker text fields also accept printable text, paste, Backspace, Delete, and `Ctrl+U`. Left and Right change settings
values. In the session tree, they page by ten rows.

### Transcript navigation

These actions operate on the retained transcript. They do not replace editor navigation.

| Action ID | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tui.transcript.pageUp` | Scroll toward earlier transcript rows | `pageup` |
| `tui.transcript.pageDown` | Scroll toward later transcript rows | `pagedown` |
| `tui.transcript.previousPrompt` | Jump to the preceding marked user or final assistant message | `ctrl+shift+up` |
| `tui.transcript.nextPrompt` | Jump to the following marked user or final assistant message | `ctrl+shift+down` |
| `tui.transcript.top` | Go to the earliest retained transcript row | `ctrl+home` |
| `tui.transcript.bottom` | Return to the newest transcript row and follow new output | `ctrl+end` |
| `tui.transcript.searchOpen` | Open rendered transcript search near the current viewport | `ctrl+shift+f` |
| `tui.transcript.searchNext` | Select and reveal the next match | `enter`, `ctrl+g` |
| `tui.transcript.searchPrevious` | Select and reveal the previous match | `shift+enter`, `ctrl+shift+g` |
| `tui.transcript.searchClose` | Close search and restore composer input | `escape` |

Search navigation chords are active only while the search bar is open, so its default `Ctrl+G` does not replace the
external-editor chord in the composer.

## Key notation

Names are case-insensitive, and ohm normalizes modifier order. Supported modifiers are `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`,
`super`, `hyper`, and `meta`. Write combinations as `ctrl+shift+p`. Named keys include arrows, navigation keys,
function keys, keypad keys, `enter`, `escape`, `space`, and `tab`. One action can own more than one chord.

Embedding code can pass a public `Keybindings` object to the terminal controller. An override replaces the default for
that action. An empty array leaves it unbound. Unknown action names and malformed chords are rejected.
`Keybindings.conflicts()` reports duplicate chords within the editor, selection, session, model, and tree
scopes. Avoid these conflicts because precedence depends on the active screen. The shared `Ctrl+C` ownership of
`tui.input.copy` and `app.clear` is intentional.

## Persisted overrides

Edit the `keybindings` object in `<ohm-home>/config.json`. The default path is
`~/.ohm/config.json`. If `OHM_HOME` is set, the file lives in that directory.

A fresh global configuration contains an empty `keybindings` object, which keeps every platform default. A newly
created project override omits it for the same result. Add only the actions you want to change, with one chord or an
array of chords. Use an empty array to unbind the action. `KEYBINDING_ACTIONS` and `DEFAULT_KEYBINDINGS` from
`ohm/tui` expose the accepted actions and defaults. `/hotkeys` shows the common active bindings. For example:

```json
{
  "keybindings": {
    "app.model.select": "alt+k",
    "tui.editor.cursorWordLeft": ["alt+left", "alt+b"]
  }
}
```

Both interactive entry points load this object. `/refresh` validates and applies changes to host actions, built-in
editor components, and direct extension UI as one live keymap.

Runtime extensions register standalone shortcuts with `registerShortcut`. Host actions keep precedence. Conflicting
extension shortcuts are not activated. Document the chord in the package README and choose one the target terminal is
unlikely to intercept.

## Terminal diagnosis

If a key does not work:

1. Run `/hotkeys` and confirm the expected action.
2. Test the chord in the same terminal without tmux, screen, or an IDE keybinding layer.
3. Check whether the terminal sends a distinct sequence for modified Enter, Tab, or Escape.
4. Prefer a simpler chord when a remote shell cannot preserve enhanced keyboard sequences.

See [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) for tmux and platform recipes.
