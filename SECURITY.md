# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use the repository's private vulnerability-reporting form under **Security → Report a vulnerability**. Include the affected version, operating system, a minimal reproduction, impact, and any known mitigations. Do not place credentials, private source, exploit details, or user data in a public issue.

If private reporting is unavailable, open a public issue that asks a maintainer to establish a private channel. Describe only the affected component and general impact until that channel exists.

Maintainers should acknowledge a complete report within seven days, establish severity and next steps, and coordinate disclosure with the reporter. A fix may be released without advance public detail when disclosure would increase user risk.

## Supported versions

ohm is a pre-1.0 project. Security fixes target the latest published minor line. Older pre-release lines may require upgrading rather than receiving a backport. The release notes identify security-relevant migrations or mitigations.

## Security boundary

Runtime extensions and managed packages are trusted local code. They have the invoking user's operating-system access and the complete extension API once enabled. Project-local executable resources stay blocked until the workspace is trusted, but trust is not a process sandbox and package metadata does not define secondary capability tiers. Prefer brokered provider requests when direct credentials are unnecessary. Credential-store handles remain private, and no credential may be included in logs, reports, extension messages, session exports, or vulnerability reproductions. Terminal-input listeners, editor replacement, and custom TUI components expose keyboard and terminal authority, so loading a package that uses them must be treated as granting interactive-terminal control.

Built-in local shell execution drops accidentally inherited environment entries whose names identify common credentials, plus values that begin with an authenticated URL. Removed nonempty values are registered for output redaction. This is a defense against accidental child-process inheritance, not an operating-system isolation boundary: a trusted extension or spawn hook can deliberately add environment entries, and commands still run as the invoking user. It does not protect secrets from another same-user process that can inspect them through facilities such as `/proc` or a debugger, nor from commands that can read user-accessible files, credential agents, or metadata services.
